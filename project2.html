                    <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:18px">In the recent year, with the rapid development of chatbots, chat commerce becomes a new trend in e-commerce. More and more enterprises or retailers would like to develop a chatbot which can communicate with their customers.However, people aren’t familiar with chatbot and wouldn’t want to interact with it because of knowing it is a bot or thinking it isn’t smart.Therefore, it’s a key point to  know which feature of chatbot would increase people’s  intention to use or intention to purchase something in chatbot.
                    <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

                    <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:24px"><strong>Project Goals</strong></span></p>

                    <ul dir="ltr">
	                <li style="list-style-type:circle"><span style="font-size:18px">Exploring which reason could make people want to purchase merchandise in chatbot.</span></li>
	                <li style="list-style-type:circle"><span style="font-size:18px">Finding which features of chatbot could make people feel close with chatbot and that could increase their purchase intention.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:24px"><strong>Theory development and hypotheses</strong></span></p>

                    <p><span style="font-size:18px">Through literature reading, I find that if decrease psychological distance between customers and retailers, that would increase customers&rsquo; purchase intention. Therefore,I deduct that decreasing psychological distance between customers and chatbot would increase customers&rsquo; intention to purchase in chatbot.</br> Media richness theory states that communication consists of a variety of cues that convey both information and help a receiver resolve ambiguity and uncertainty by providing a social, emotional, or task-related context(Otondo, 2008). Chatbot is a new communication media.Thus, we could explore media richness of chatbot to realize the communication capability of it has. Media richness consists of immediate feedback, personal focus, multiple of cues(Daft &amp; Lengel, 1987) , the explanation are as follow:</span></p>

                        <ul>
                            <li style="list-style-type:circle"><span style="font-size:18px">Immediate feedback: the capability of responding instantly and revise problems</span></li>
                            <li style="list-style-type:circle"><span style="font-size:18px">Personal focus: adding emotion or personality in communication would comprehensively express message to others</span></li>
                            <li style="list-style-type:circle"><span style="font-size:18px">Multiple of cues: a series of information cues including voice, body language ,texts , numbers, and symbols</span></li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><span style="font-size:24px"><strong>Hypotheses</strong></span></p>
                    
                        <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:18px">Gunawardena(1995)consider that immediacy could make people feel interaction with others by decreasing time of intermediary communication. This method could decrease psychological distance between human and human.Therefore,I inferred that when immediate feedback is increased, the psychological distance between human and chatbot would be decreased.<br />
                         <li style="list-style-type: square"><strong>H1:Chatbot&rsquo;s immediate feedback negatively affects psychological distance between human and chatbot.</strong></li></span></p>
                        
                        
                        <p><span style="font-size:18px">Previous thesis shows that &nbsp;sense of humor and pleasure could decrease psychological distance between human and human in interpersonal communication,and enhance relationship(Graham, 1995). &nbsp;<br />
                        Hence,I inferred that when personal focus is increased, the psychological distance between human and chatbot would be decreased.<br />
                        <li style="list-style-type: square" ><strong>H2 :Chatbot&rsquo;s personal focus negatively affects psychological distance between human and chatbot.</strong></li></span></p>
                        
                        
                        <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:18px">According to social presence theory, the richer the multiple information of &nbsp;media provides,the more socio-emotional communication would happen(Hiltz, Johnson &amp; Turoff , 1986).Thus,I inferred that when multiple of information cues are increased, the psychological distance between human and chatbot would be decreased.<br />
                        <li style="list-style-type: square" ><strong>H3 : Chatbot&rsquo;s multiple of information cues negatively affects psychological distance between human and chatbot.</strong></li></span></p>
                    
                        
                        <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:18px">Decreasing psychological distance would make people feel close to each other.<br />
                        Ng (2013) indicated intimate emotional connections will motivate people&rsquo;s intention to purchase.Therefore,I inferred that the psychological distance between human and chatbot decrease, human would feel &nbsp;more intimate with chatbot and the close connection would increase their purchase intention.<br />
                        <li style="list-style-type: square" ><strong>H4: &nbsp;Psychological distance between human and chatbot &nbsp;negatively affects humans&rsquo; purchase intention.</strong></li></span></p>

                        <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:18px">In my research,I use <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/17viLA8zslRyan-CMF-3EDzvhb6jeA-zw/view?usp=sharing">questionnaire</a> to investigate which chatbot&rsquo;s feature could decrease psychological distance between human and chatbot.<br />
                        Many companies have begun to use chatbots as assistants for their websites, such as eBay, H&amp;M, Macy&#39;s, etc. eBay is an online retailer that many people know, and its chatbot is placed on Facebook Messenger, which is easier for users to reach and has variety of products online. Thus, this study chose eBay ShopBot as a bot for experiencing.</span></p>
